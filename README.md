# Hospital-Management-System

Project Overview: Hospital Management System (HMS)
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL, designed to streamline and digitize the core operations of a hospital. This system provides secure, role-based access for Admin, Doctor, and Patient, allowing seamless coordination of appointments, medical records, user registration, and doctor-patient interactions.

It features a centralized database to manage patient histories, prescriptions, doctor schedules, and feedback. Admins can add or remove doctors, monitor patient data, and maintain hospital records. Patients can book appointments, view their reports, and contact doctors, while doctors can manage their profiles and update treatment history.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of full-stack web development, database design, and local server deployment using XAMPP, making it a comprehensive solution for hospital automation.
